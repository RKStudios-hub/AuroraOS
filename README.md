## My Portfolio as a beginner

An fun, OS-style portfolio website built just for fun — making a desktop interface in the browser because why not?

## What is this?

It's basically a fake operating system that acts as my portfolio. Think of it as Windows/macOS but worse and made by a kid who thought "I can do that!"

## Features

- 🖥️ Desktop with icons you can click (and drag around)
- 📂 Windows that open, close, and minimize (somewhat like real OS)
- 🎮 Terminal that pretends to be Linux (very badly)
- 🎨 Paint app where you can actually draw
- 🌐 Browser with a custom homepage (Bing-powered search)
- 🎵 Background music with a cool visualizer in the menu bar
- ⏰ Clock widget that shows time (surprisingly accurate)
- 📢 Notifications that pop up at random times
- And more things I probably forgot...

## Tech Used

React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion — the usual stuff kids use to impress their friends.

## How to Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 and pretend you're using a computer from the future.
